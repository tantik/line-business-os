/**
 * Regression guard for the "language toggle doesn't translate anything"
 * bug: `PreviewLanguageToggle` previously held its own local `useState`,
 * completely disconnected from the shared `LangProvider`/`useLang()`
 * mechanism, so clicking it only re-highlighted itself.
 *
 * Trimmed 2026-08-16 when the `_client-preview` route tree (Surface A) was
 * retired: this file used to also exercise several Surface-A-only files
 * (route pages, `states.tsx`, `preview-recipe-kind-manager.tsx`,
 * `preview-staff-form.tsx`, `preview-shift-exchange-manager-panel.tsx`,
 * `recipe-list-title.ts`, `manager-recipe-title-translations.ts`) that no
 * longer exist. Only the assertion about this still-shared component's own
 * source remains.
